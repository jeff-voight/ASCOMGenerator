                Structure to hold astrometric catalogue data
            


                The astrometric catalog data for a star; equator and equinox and units will depend on the catalog. 
                While this structure can be used as a generic container for catalog data, all high-level 
                NOVAS-C functions require J2000.0 catalog data with FK5-type units (shown in square brackets below).
