 Convert sexagesimal degrees to binary double-precision degrees
 
The sexagesimal to real conversion methods such as this one are flexible enough to convert just 
 about anything that resembles sexagesimal. Thee way they operate is to first separate the input string 
 into numeric "tokens", strings consisting only of the numerals 0-9, plus and minus, and period. All other 
 characters are considered delimiters. Once the input string is parsed into tokens they are converted to 
 numerics. 
		If there are more than three numeric tokens, only the first three are considered, the remainder 
 are ignored. Left to right positionally, the tokens are assumed to represent units (degrees or hours), 
 minutes, and seconds. If only two tokens are present, they are assumed to be units and minutes, and if 
 only one token is present, it is assumed to be units. Any token can have a fractionsl part. Of course it 
 would not be normal (for example) for both the minutes and seconds parts to have fractional parts, but it 
 would be legal. So 00:30.5:30 would convert to 1.0 unit. 
		Note that plain units, for example 23.128734523 are acceptable to the method.

 Convert an array of .NET built-in types to an equivalent Variant arrray (array of .NET Objects)
 
This function will primarily be of use to Scripting Language programmers who need to convert Camera and Video ImageArrays from their native types to Variant types. If this is not done, 
 the scripting language will throw a type mismatch exception when it receives, for example, Int32 element types instead of the expected Variant types.
 A VBScript Camera usage example is: Image = UTIL.ArrayToVariantArray(CAMERA.ImageArray) This example assumes that the camera and utilities objects have already been created with CreateObject statements.
		The supported .NET types are:
 
				Int16
				Int32
				UInt16
				UInt32
				UInt64
				Byte
				SByte
				Single
				Double
				Boolean
				DateTime
				String
