 Invokes the specified device-specific action.
 
Can throw a not implemented exception 
 This method is intended for use in all current and future device types and to avoid name clashes, management of action names 
 is important from day 1. A two-part naming convention will be adopted - DeviceType:UniqueActionName where:
 
			DeviceType is the same value as would be used by  e.g. Telescope, Camera, Switch etc.
			UniqueActionName is a single word, or multiple words joined by underscore characters, that sensibly describes the action to be performed.
		
		
 It is recommended that UniqueActionNames should be a maximum of 16 characters for legibility.
 Should the same function and UniqueActionName be supported by more than one type of device, the reserved DeviceType of 
 “General” will be used. Action names will be case insensitive, so FilterWheel:SelectWheel, filterwheel:selectwheel 
 and FILTERWHEEL:SELECTWHEEL will all refer to the same action.
		The names of all supported actions must be returned in the  property.
