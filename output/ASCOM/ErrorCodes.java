              Error numbers for use by drivers.
            


              The range of permitted values falls within the class FACILTY_ITF as 
              defined by the operating system and COM. These values will never clash with 
              COM, RPC, or OS error codes.
              
                Driver developers may extend this class by making use of the partial keyword.
