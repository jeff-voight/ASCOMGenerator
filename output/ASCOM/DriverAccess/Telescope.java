            Indicates the pointing state of the mount.
            

            For historical reasons, this property's name does not reflect its true meaning. The name will not be changed (so as to preserve 
            compatibility), but the meaning has since become clear. All conventional mounts have two pointing states for a given equatorial (sky) position. 
            Mechanical limitations often make it impossible for the mount to position the optics at given HA/Dec in one of the two pointing 
            states, but there are places where the same point can be reached sensibly in both pointing states (e.g. near the pole and 
            close to the meridian). In order to understand these pointing states, consider the following (thanks to Patrick Wallace for this info):
            All conventional telescope mounts have two axes nominally at right angles. For an equatorial, the longitude axis is mechanical 
            hour angle and the latitude axis is mechanical declination. Sky coordinates and mechanical coordinates are two completely separate arenas. 
            This becomes rather more obvious if your mount is an altaz, but it's still true for an equatorial. Both mount axes can in principle 
            move over a range of 360 deg. This is distinct from sky HA/Dec, where Dec is limited to a 180 deg range (+90 to -90).  Apart from 
            practical limitations, any point in the sky can be seen in two mechanical orientations. To get from one to the other the HA axis 
            is moved 180 deg and the Dec axis is moved through the pole a distance twice the sky codeclination (90 - sky declination).
            Mechanical zero HA/Dec will be one of the two ways of pointing at the intersection of the celestial equator and the local meridian. 
            In order to support Dome slaving, where it is important to know which side of the pier the mount is actually on, ASCOM has adopted the 
            convention that the Normal pointing state will be the state where a German Equatorial mount is on the East side of the pier, looking West, with the 
            counterweights below the optical assembly and that  will represent this pointing state.
            Move your scope to this position and consider the two mechanical encoders zeroed. The two pointing states are, then:
            
            Normal ()Where the mechanical Dec is in the range -90 deg to +90 deg
            Beyond the pole ()Where the mechanical Dec is in the range -180 deg to -90 deg or +90 deg to +180 deg.
            
            
            "Side of pier" is a "consequence" of the former definition, not something fundamental. 
            Apart from mechanical interference, the telescope can move from one side of the pier to the other without the mechanical Dec 
            having changed: you could track Polaris forever with the telescope moving from west of pier to east of pier or vice versa every 12h. 
            Thus, "side of pier" is, in general, not a useful term (except perhaps in a loose, descriptive, explanatory sense). 
            All this applies to a fork mount just as much as to a GEM, and it would be wrong to make the "beyond pole" state illegal for the 
            former. Your mount may not be able to get there if your camera hits the fork, but it's possible on some mounts. Whether this is useful 
            depends on whether you're in Hawaii or Finland.
            To first order, the relationship between sky and mechanical HA/Dec is as follows:
            Normal state:
            
            HA_sky  = HA_mech
            Dec_sky = Dec_mech
            
            
            Beyond the pole
            
            HA_sky  = HA_mech + 12h, expressed in range ± 12h
            Dec_sky = 180d - Dec_mech, expressed in range ± 90d
            
            
            Astronomy software often needs to know which which pointing state the mount is in. Examples include setting guiding polarities 
            and calculating dome opening azimuth/altitude. The meaning of the SideOfPier property, then is:
            
            pierEastNormal pointing state
            pierWestBeyond the pole pointing state
            
            
            If the mount hardware reports neither the true pointing state (or equivalent) nor the mechanical declination axis position 
            (which varies from -180 to +180), a driver cannot calculate the pointing state, and *must not* implement SideOfPier.
            If the mount hardware reports only the mechanical declination axis position (-180 to +180) then a driver can calculate SideOfPier as follows:
            
            pierEast = abs(mechanical dec) <= 90 deg

            NOTES:
            
            If the driver does not know whether the attached telescope does its own refraction, and if the driver does not itself calculate 
            refraction, this property (if implemented) must raise an error when read.
            Writing to this property is optional. Often, a telescope (or its driver) calculates refraction using standard atmospheric parameters.
            If the client wishes to calculate a more accurate refraction, then this property could be set to False and these 
            client-refracted coordinates used.
            If disabling the telescope or driver's refraction is not supported, the driver must raise an error when an attempt to set 
            this property to False is made. 
            Setting this property to True for a telescope or driver that does refraction, or to False for a telescope or driver that 
            does not do refraction, shall not raise an error. It shall have no effect.

            For historical reasons, this property's name does not reflect its true meaning. The name will not be changed (so as to preserve 
            compatibility), but the meaning has since become clear. All conventional mounts have two pointing states for a given equatorial (sky) position. 
            Mechanical limitations often make it impossible for the mount to position the optics at given HA/Dec in one of the two pointing 
            states, but there are places where the same point can be reached sensibly in both pointing states (e.g. near the pole and 
            close to the meridian). In order to understand these pointing states, consider the following (thanks to Patrick Wallace for this info):
            All conventional telescope mounts have two axes nominally at right angles. For an equatorial, the longitude axis is mechanical 
            hour angle and the latitude axis is mechanical declination. Sky coordinates and mechanical coordinates are two completely separate arenas. 
            This becomes rather more obvious if your mount is an altaz, but it's still true for an equatorial. Both mount axes can in principle 
            move over a range of 360 deg. This is distinct from sky HA/Dec, where Dec is limited to a 180 deg range (+90 to -90).  Apart from 
            practical limitations, any point in the sky can be seen in two mechanical orientations. To get from one to the other the HA axis 
            is moved 180 deg and the Dec axis is moved through the pole a distance twice the sky codeclination (90 - sky declination).
            Mechanical zero HA/Dec will be one of the two ways of pointing at the intersection of the celestial equator and the local meridian. 
            In order to support Dome slaving, where it is important to know which side of the pier the mount is actually on, ASCOM has adopted the 
            convention that the Normal pointing state will be the state where a German Equatorial mount is on the East side of the pier, looking West, with the 
            counterweights below the optical assembly and that  will represent this pointing state.
            Move your scope to this position and consider the two mechanical encoders zeroed. The two pointing states are, then:
            
            Normal ()Where the mechanical Dec is in the range -90 deg to +90 deg
            Beyond the pole ()Where the mechanical Dec is in the range -180 deg to -90 deg or +90 deg to +180 deg.
            
            
            "Side of pier" is a "consequence" of the former definition, not something fundamental. 
            Apart from mechanical interference, the telescope can move from one side of the pier to the other without the mechanical Dec 
            having changed: you could track Polaris forever with the telescope moving from west of pier to east of pier or vice versa every 12h. 
            Thus, "side of pier" is, in general, not a useful term (except perhaps in a loose, descriptive, explanatory sense). 
            All this applies to a fork mount just as much as to a GEM, and it would be wrong to make the "beyond pole" state illegal for the 
            former. Your mount may not be able to get there if your camera hits the fork, but it's possible on some mounts. Whether this is useful 
            depends on whether you're in Hawaii or Finland.
            To first order, the relationship between sky and mechanical HA/Dec is as follows:
            Normal state:
            
            HA_sky  = HA_mech
            Dec_sky = Dec_mech
            
            
            Beyond the pole
            
            HA_sky  = HA_mech + 12h, expressed in range ± 12h
            Dec_sky = 180d - Dec_mech, expressed in range ± 90d
            
            
            Astronomy software often needs to know which which pointing state the mount is in. Examples include setting guiding polarities 
            and calculating dome opening azimuth/altitude. The meaning of the SideOfPier property, then is:
            
            pierEastNormal pointing state
            pierWestBeyond the pole pointing state
            
            
            If the mount hardware reports neither the true pointing state (or equivalent) nor the mechanical declination axis position 
            (which varies from -180 to +180), a driver cannot calculate the pointing state, and *must not* implement SideOfPier.
            If the mount hardware reports only the mechanical declination axis position (-180 to +180) then a driver can calculate SideOfPier as follows:
            
            pierEast = abs(mechanical dec) <= 90 deg
            pierWest = abs(mechanical Dec) > 90 deg
            
            
            It is allowed (though not required) that this property may be written to force the mount to flip. Doing so, however, may change 
            the right ascension of the telescope. During flipping, Telescope.Slewing must return True.
            This property is only available in telescope InterfaceVersions 2 and 3.

            practical limitations, any point in the sky can be seen in two mechanical orientations. To get from one to the other the HA axis 
            is moved 180 deg and the Dec axis is moved through the pole a distance twice the sky codeclination (90 - sky declination).
            Mechanical zero HA/Dec will be one of the two ways of pointing at the intersection of the celestial equator and the local meridian. 
            In order to support Dome slaving, where it is important to know which side of the pier the mount is actually on, ASCOM has adopted the 
            convention that the Normal pointing state will be the state where a German Equatorial mount is on the East side of the pier, looking West, with the 
            counterweights below the optical assembly and that  will represent this pointing state.
            Move your scope to this position and consider the two mechanical encoders zeroed. The two pointing states are, then:
            
            Normal ()Where the mechanical Dec is in the range -90 deg to +90 deg
            Beyond the pole ()Where the mechanical Dec is in the range -180 deg to -90 deg or +90 deg to +180 deg.
            
            
            "Side of pier" is a "consequence" of the former definition, not something fundamental. 
            Apart from mechanical interference, the telescope can move from one side of the pier to the other without the mechanical Dec 
            having changed: you could track Polaris forever with the telescope moving from west of pier to east of pier or vice versa every 12h. 
            Thus, "side of pier" is, in general, not a useful term (except perhaps in a loose, descriptive, explanatory sense). 
            All this applies to a fork mount just as much as to a GEM, and it would be wrong to make the "beyond pole" state illegal for the 
            former. Your mount may not be able to get there if your camera hits the fork, but it's possible on some mounts. Whether this is useful 
            depends on whether you're in Hawaii or Finland.
            To first order, the relationship between sky and mechanical HA/Dec is as follows:
            Normal state:
            
            HA_sky  = HA_mech
            Dec_sky = Dec_mech
            
            
            Beyond the pole
            
            HA_sky  = HA_mech + 12h, expressed in range ± 12h
            Dec_sky = 180d - Dec_mech, expressed in range ± 90d
            
            
            Astronomy software often needs to know which which pointing state the mount is in. Examples include setting guiding polarities 
            and calculating dome opening azimuth/altitude. The meaning of the SideOfPier property, then is:
            
            pierEastNormal pointing state
            pierWestBeyond the pole pointing state
            
            
            If the mount hardware reports neither the true pointing state (or equivalent) nor the mechanical declination axis position 
            (which varies from -180 to +180), a driver cannot calculate the pointing state, and *must not* implement SideOfPier.
            If the mount hardware reports only the mechanical declination axis position (-180 to +180) then a driver can calculate SideOfPier as follows:
            
            pierEast = abs(mechanical dec) <= 90 deg
            pierWest = abs(mechanical Dec) > 90 deg
            
            
            It is allowed (though not required) that this property may be written to force the mount to flip. Doing so, however, may change 
            the right ascension of the telescope. During flipping, Telescope.Slewing must return True.
            This property is only available in telescope InterfaceVersions 2 and 3.
            Pointing State and Side of Pier - Help for Driver Developers
            A further document, "Pointing State and Side of Pier", is installed in the Developer Documentation folder by the ASCOM Developer 
            Components installer. This further explains the pointing state concept and includes diagrams illustrating how it relates 
            to physical side of pier for German equatorial telescopes. It also includes details of the tests performed by Conform to determine whether 
            the driver correctly reports the pointing state as defined above.
