Please be careful if you wish to convert this string into a number within your application

 than point as the decimal separator. 
 If your application tries to convert 5.5 into a Double value when running on a PC localised to 
 France, you will get an exception because the French decimal separater is comma and 5.5 is not 
 a valid representation of a decimal number in that locale.
		If you still wish to turn the Platform Version into a Double value, you can use an 
 approach such as this:
		If Double.Parse(Util.PlatformVersion, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture) < 5.5 Then...
		If you just wish to test whether the platform is greater than a particular level,
 you can use the IsMinimumRequiredVersion method.

 Convert sexagesimal degrees to binary double-precision degrees
 
The sexagesimal to real conversion methods such as this one are flexible enough to convert just 
 about anything that resembles sexagesimal. Thee way they operate is to first separate the input string 
 into numeric "tokens", strings consisting only of the numerals 0-9, plus and minus, and period. All other 
 characters are considered delimiters. Once the input string is parsed into tokens they are converted to 
 numerics. 
		If there are more than three numeric tokens, only the first three are considered, the remainder 
 are ignored. Left to right positionally, the tokens are assumed to represent units (degrees or hours), 
 minutes, and seconds. If only two tokens are present, they are assumed to be units and minutes, and if 
 only one token is present, it is assumed to be units. Any token can have a fractionsl part. Of course it 
 would not be normal (for example) for both the minutes and seconds parts to have fractional parts, but it 
 would be legal. So 00:30.5:30 would convert to 1.0 unit. 
		Note that plain units, for example 23.128734523 are acceptable to the method.
