 The type of parity used on the serial port
 


 Parity is an error-checking procedure in which the number of 1s must always be the 
 same — either even or odd — for each group of bits that is transmitted without error. 
 Parity is one of the parameters that must be 
 agreed upon by both sending and receiving parties before transmission can take place.
