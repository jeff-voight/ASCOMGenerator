              This method is called by  to initialize the settings provider.
              Normally, this will set the provider's  property to the assembly name
              of the application. This is later used to determine the storage location of each of the settings.
              However, for ASCOM purposes, we can't use the application name and we need to key off the
              ASCOM DeviceID of the driver, so in ASCOM.SettingsProvider, the application name is set but never used.
